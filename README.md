# Conversation Summarizer using Large Language Models
## Project Overview
- Development of conversation summarization models using techniques like TF-IDF, TextRank, T5, BART, and GPT-4.
- Deployment of the model on Streamlit for user interaction.

## Goals and Objectives
- Develop a model that provides concise and coherent summaries from conversations.
- Perform quantitative evaluation and comparative analysis across various models.
- Visualize data and model performance using graphical representations.

## Dataset
- Utilized the DialogSum dataset with over 13K samples, split into training, testing, and validation sets.

## Methodology
- Implemented extractive and abstractive summarization methods.
- Evaluated models using ROUGE scores for precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
- Fine-tuned models showed significant improvements in performance metrics.
- GPT-4 demonstrated superior capabilities in comparison to other models.

## Demonstration
- Hosted an interactive demonstration on Streamlit: [Link to Streamlit App](https://conversation-summarizer.streamlit.app/)

## How to Use
- Instructions on how to interact with the Streamlit application to get conversation summaries.

## Future Work
- Suggestions on enhancing model capabilities and user experience.
